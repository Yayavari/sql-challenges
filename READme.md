# SQL Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to various SQL problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and StrataScratch. The goal is to improve my database querying skills through hands-on practice with real-world questions.

## 📁 Structure

The solutions are organized by platform:
1. Leetcode
2. Hackerrank
3. Strata Scratch

Each `.sql` file includes:
- The problem name
- A brief description (if needed)
- My SQL solution

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen SQL fundamentals
- Practice joins, subqueries, CTEs, window functions, etc.
- Build a resource I can refer to or share with others

## ✅ How to Use

You can explore any folder and open the `.sql` files to see the query solutions. Feel free to try the queries on your preferred SQL editor or online platforms.

## 📌 Note

These solutions are based on my understanding. There might be multiple ways to solve each problem — feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
